# Messenger App

## Introduction

This project is a simple messenger application, similar to Telegram, that allows users to communicate with each other via text messages. Users can find each other using unique nicknames. The application will be developed using a microservice architecture, with a backend written in Node.js and Java Spring, and a frontend built with React.js. Data will be stored in the cloud using PostgreSQL for user authentication and login data, and MongoDB for streaming user data, such as messages.
